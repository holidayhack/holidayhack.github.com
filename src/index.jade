          Do you want to work on awesome programming projects in your free time and get
          paid while doing it?
        p.highlight
          | I will pay you <span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span> for an approximated
          | two-days worth of <em>concentrated in-the-zone coding</em> every saturdays,
          | every weeks.
        p
          | That's <span class="money">&#3647;10,000</span> a month! Continue reading if
          | you are interested.
        h2 How does this works?
        ol
          li
            | You send me one
            | <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull request</a>
            | at the end of each week and we do a mini code review and demo session.
          li
            | A little chit-chat of what have we been up to and what should we be doing
            | next. Your pull request gets merged and perhaps, deployed.
          li
            | I give you the week's pay and we're on our way.
        p
          | No mid-week harassments or interruptions. No 3AM calls. Work where you want,
          | whenever you want. Send good pull request, meetup and get paid, nothing else
          | is needed.
        h2 One coder army
        :markdown
          Since **one coder does not scale** and I have a full time job now just like you,
          I figured it is better that I hire other people to help than to try to do
          everything myself and never gets anything done.
        p.highlight
          | Think of this as me doing a lot of micro startups.
        :markdown
          I am a coder myself, so you can expect a lot of freedom to go about how you do
          the job. Plus I understand how it is so much better to work alone on your own
          terms than on a team of sub-averages who don't understand the simplest of your
          approach.

            | You have to do some live coding test such as a FUBAR loop or a data
            | structure implementation before you will be accepted. The exact test may
            | varies according to my judgement.

            | arrogance and smart-asses. If you have any issue with any
            | of these, please do not bother applying.
          li
            | The constant here is the weekly pay of
            | <span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span> and a <em>good</em> pull request.
            | Feel free to skew the time if you believe you have completed a worthwhile
            | work.

            | Unlimited holidays. Skip out whenever you want. You will simply not be paid
            | for the week. Just don't disappear for too long without at least an email.

        h2 Can I use Ruby, Python, Node.JS or X?
        p
          | Sure, use whatever you are good at. Personally, though, I hate
          | <code>PHP</code> and <code>Java</code> so try not to use it.

          their practicality and applicability and how it effects your preferred

          We will share the responsibility of any deployment and keeping the
          software up and running if the project have a server component.
        h2 How do I get paid?
        :markdown
          In cash, in face-to-face meeting, every Saturdays in exchange
          for the week's pull request and half-an-hour of talk.
        h3 What about sharing?
        :markdown
          Sure, if you think the project is a good idea to invest, I'm willing to share a
          large portion (up to 50%) of it with you in addition to the weekly constant.  We
          can negotiate this as soon as we have something viable for launch.

        :markdown
          I may give you a coding test to find out about your skills.
          If you got it, please take the time to do it in a concise,
          elegant, clean and performant way.
          Remember that bad coding style is a big no-no with me.
