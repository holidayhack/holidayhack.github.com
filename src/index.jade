          Do you want to make some money really quick?
          I have several projects as well as some of my friends'
          to which I would like to see put into reality.
        p.highlight
          | I will pay you <span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span>
          | every week for 2 days worth of
          | concentrated in-the-zone coding.
          | You chose where, when, how <em>and how long</em>
          | to work and I will pay you <strong>cash for a patch</strong>
          | and some chit-chat every other Saturdays.
        p Sounds good? Continue reading if you're interested.

        h2 One coder army
        :markdown
          Since **one coder does not scale** to multiple projects
          and I have a full time job now (just like many of you guys)
          I figured it is better that I hire other people to help
          than to try to do everything myself and never gets anything done.
        p.highlight
          | Think of this as me doing micro-funding for my ideas.
        :markdown
          I am a coder myself, so you can expect a lot of freedom to
          go about how you do the job. Plus I understand how it is
          so much better to work alone on your own terms than on a
          team of sub-averages who don't understand the simplest
          of your approach.
        h2 Conditions
        ul
          li
            | If you do not know me personally, I will have to ask you to
            | do some simple tests first (such as a FUBAR loop.)
          li
            | Bad coding style will be rejected on first sight.
          li
            | The constant here is the weekly pay of
            | <span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span>. If you are
            | good, feel free to spend only 2 hour(s) per week if you
            | think you can match that amount. Just remember that
            | I'm a coder too.
          li
            | I will inform you if I think you have been slacking or
            | you are doing more than meets the pay (e.g. when it's a holiday)
          li
            | You can skip any week whenever you want (pay for that week
            | will be skipped.) Just don't disappear for too long without
            | at least an email.
          li
            | There is nothing to sign. We prefer
            | <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy" alt="Meritocracy">Meritocracy</a>
            | over legalities.
          li
            | Also mean that anyone may stop working from either side at
            | any time, should the work (or pay) be unsatisfactory.
          li
            | Oh, and you have to be able to meet me in person in
            | Bankgok, Thailand. (I know, I wrote this just in case :-)
        h2 Can I use Ruby/Python/Node.JS/X?
        p
          | Sure, use whatever you are good at. Personally, though, I hate
          | <code>PHP</code> and <code>Java</code> so try not to use it. An
          | all-<abbr title="opensource software">OSS</abbr> stack is also
          | preferred (but not required.)
        p
          | Cloud-hostable solution is also preferred (i.e. 
          | <a href="http://heroku.com" alt="Heroku">Heroku</a>.)
        :markdown
          We will share the responsibility of any deployment and keeping the
          software up and running if the project is a website. Which means we
          should both have administrative access to the servers.
        h2 How do I get paid?
        :markdown
          In cash, in face-to-face meeting, every Saturdays in exchange
          for the week's patch and half-an-hour of talk.
        h3 What about sharing?
        :markdown
          Sure, if you think the project is a good idea to invest, I'm
          willing to share a large portion (up to 50%) of it with you.
          We can negotiate this as soon as we have something viable for launch.

        p
          | I am able to support up to 3 projects at the moment.
          | I will try to hire more if and when my budget allows.

          | or ping me <a href="http://twitter.com/chakrit">@chakrit</a> on Twitter
          | to get in touch. I will get back to you within 2
          | <strike>holi-</strike>days if not immediately.
        :markdown
          Also, I may give you a coding test to find out about your skills.
          If you got it, please take the time to do it in a concise,
          elegant, clean and performant way.
          Remember that bad coding style is a big no-no with me.
