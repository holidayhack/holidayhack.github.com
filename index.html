paid while doing it?</p><p class="highlight">I will pay you <span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span> for an approximated
two-days worth of <em>concentrated in-the-zone coding</em> every saturdays,
every weeks.</p><p>That's <span class="money">&#3647;10,000</span> a month! Continue reading if
you are interested.</p><h2>How does this works?</h2><ol><li>You send me one
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">pull request</a>
at the end of each week and we do a mini code review and demo session.</li><li>A little chit-chat of what have we been up to and what should we be doing
next. Your pull request gets merged and perhaps, deployed.</li><li>I give you the week's pay and we're on our way.</li></ol><p>No mid-week harassments or interruptions. No 3AM calls. Work where you want,
whenever you want. Send good pull request, meetup and get paid, nothing else
is needed.</p><h2>One coder army</h2><p>Since <strong>one coder does not scale</strong> and I have a full time job now just like you,
I figured it is better that I hire other people to help than to try to do
everything myself and never gets anything done.</p><p class="highlight">Think of this as me doing a lot of micro startups.</p><p>I am a coder myself, so you can expect a lot of freedom to go about how you do
the job. Plus I understand how it is so much better to work alone on your own
terms than on a team of sub-averages who don&#39;t understand the simplest of your
approach.</p><h2>Conditions</h2><ol><li>You must be able to speak and listen at least average English. We may also
consider some level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinglish">Tinglish</a>.</li><li>You have to do some live coding test such as a FUBAR loop or a data
structure implementation before you will be accepted. The exact test may
varies according to my judgement.</li><li>Things that will not be tolerated includes:
<a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">blub programmer</a>,
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BadCodingStandards">bad coding style</a>,
arrogance and smart-asses. If you have any issue with any
of these, please do not bother applying.</li><li>The constant here is the weekly pay of
<span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span> and a <em>good</em> pull request.
Feel free to skew the time if you believe you have completed a worthwhile
work.</li><li>Unlimited holidays. Skip out whenever you want. You will simply not be paid
for the week. Just don't disappear for too long without at least an email.</li><li>We prefer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy" alt="Meritocracy">Meritocracy</a>
over legalities. We keep all legal document bullshit to the barest minimum.</li><li>Also mean that anyone may stop working from either side at
any time, should the work (or pay) be unsatisfactory.</li><li>Oh, and you have to be able to meet me in person in
Bankgok, Thailand. (hint: look at the domain :-)</li></ol><h2>Can I use Ruby, Python, Node.JS or X?</h2><p>Sure, use whatever you are good at. Personally, though, I hate
<code>PHP</code> and <code>Java</code> so try not to use it.</p><p class="highlight">An all-<abbr title="opensource software">OSS</abbr> stack is preferred as well as cloud-hostable solution such as
<a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>,
<a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">OpenShift</a>,
<a href="http://nodejitsu.com">Nodejitsu</a> or even
<a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> with
<a href="https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/what-is-puppet/">Puppet</a>.</p><p>I will expect you to always be up to the latest trends including knowledge of
their practicality and applicability and how it effects your preferred
technology stack.</p><p>We will share the responsibility of any deployment and keeping the
software up and running if the project have a server component.</p><h2>How do I get paid?</h2><p>In cash, in face-to-face meeting, every Saturdays in exchange
for the week&#39;s pull request and half-an-hour of talk.</p><h3>What about sharing?</h3><p>Sure, if you think the project is a good idea to invest, I&#39;m willing to share a
large portion (up to 50%) of it with you in addition to the weekly constant.  We
can negotiate this as soon as we have something viable for launch.</p><h2><a name="interested">Interested?</a></h2><p>I am able to support up to 3 projects at the moment.
I will try to hire more if and when my budget allows.</p><p class="highlight">Email me at <a href="mailto:chakrit@holidayhack.in.th">chakrit@holidayhack.in.th</a>
or mention me <a href="http://twitter.com/chakrit">@chakrit</a> on Twitter
to get in touch. I will get back to you within 2
<strike>holi</strike>days if not immediately.</p><p>Sharing this page with friends is also totally welcome as well :)</p><p><fb:like href="https://www.facebook.com/holidayhack" /></p><h3><a name="expect">What to prepare?</a></h3><p>I may give you a coding test to find out about your skills.
If you got it, please take the time to do it in a concise,
elegant, clean and performant way.
Remember that bad coding style is a big no-no with me.</p><p>If you have decided to <a href="mailto:chakrit@holidayhack.in.th">email me</a>
and we have scheduled a meeting, please be prepared by bringing some
reference to your old work and also to talk about it at length as well.
Unpreparedness is a sign of a lack of interest.</p></div><div class="area-bottom"><p class="subtle">Oh yeah, and thanks for taking the time to read this! XD</p></div></div><div id="fb-root"></div><script src="site.js"></script><script>var sc_project=8007709;
