free time? Well, here&#39;s the gist of it:</p><p class="highlight">I will pay you <span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span>
every week for 2 days worth of
concentrated in-the-zone coding.
You chose where, when, how <em>and how long</em>
to work and I will pay you <strong>cash for a patch</strong>
and some chit-chat every other Saturdays.</p><p>That's <span class="money">&#3647;10,000</span> a month.
Continue reading if you're interested.</p><h2>One coder army</h2><p>Since <strong>one coder does not scale</strong> and I have a full time
job now just like you, I figured it is
better that I hire other people to help than to try to do
everything myself and never gets anything done.</p><p class="highlight">Think of this as me doing micro-funding for my ideas.</p><p>I am a coder myself, so you can expect a lot of freedom to
go about how you do the job. Plus I understand how it is
so much better to work alone on your own terms than on a
team of sub-averages who don&#39;t understand the simplest
of your approach.</p><h2>Conditions</h2><ul><li><p>If we have never met before, you will have to do
some coding tests first (such as a FUBAR loop) so
I know we can communicate.</p></li><li><p>...and that you&#39;re not a <a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html">Blub programmer</a>.</p></li><li>Bad coding style will be rejected on first sight.
If you don't understand what that means, please close this website immediately.</li><li>The constant here is the weekly pay of
<span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span>. Feel free to spend
only 2 hour(s) per week if you think you can match that
amount. Just remember that I'm a coder too.</li><li>Skip any week whenever you want (pay for that week
will be skipped.) Just don't disappear for too long without
at least an email or a tweet.</li><li>There is nothing to sign. No NDAs. No legal documents bullshit. We prefer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy" alt="Meritocracy">Meritocracy</a>
over legalities.</li><li>Also mean that anyone may stop working from either side at
any time, should the work (or pay) be unsatisfactory.</li><li>Oh, and you have to be able to meet me in person in
Bankgok, Thailand. (hint: look at the domain :-)</li></ul><h2>Can I use Ruby/Python/Node.JS/X?</h2><p>Sure, use whatever you are good at. Personally, though, I hate
<code>PHP</code> and <code>Java</code> so try not to use it. An
all-<abbr title="opensource software">OSS</abbr> stack is also
preferred (but not required.)</p><p class="highlight">Cloud-hostable solution such as
<a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a>, 
<a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">OpenShift</a> or
<a href="http://nodejitsu.com">Nodejitsu</a> is preferred.</p><p>We will share the responsibility of any deployment and keeping the
software up and running if the project have a server component.</p><h2>How do I get paid?</h2><p>In cash, in face-to-face meeting, every Saturdays in exchange
for the week&#39;s patch and half-an-hour of talk.</p><h3>What about sharing?</h3><p>Sure, if you think the project is a good idea to invest, I&#39;m
willing to share a large portion (up to 50%) of it with you.
We can negotiate this as soon as we have something viable for launch.</p><h2><a name="interested">Interested?</a></h2><p>I am able to support up to 3 projects at the moment.
I will try to hire more if and when my budget allows.</p><p class="highlight">Email me at <a href="mailto:chakrit@holidayhack.in.th">chakrit@holidayhack.in.th</a>
or ping me <a href="http://twitter.com/chakrit">@chakrit</a> on Twitter
to get in touch. I will get back to you within 2
<strike>holi-</strike>days if not immediately.</p><p>Sharing this page with friends is also totally welcome as well :)</p><h3><a name="expect">What to prepare?</a></h3><p>I may give you a coding test to find out about your skills.
If you got it, please take the time to do it in a concise,
elegant, clean and performant way.
Remember that bad coding style is a big no-no with me.</p><p>If you have decided to <a href="mailto:chakrit@holidayhack.in.th">email me</a>
and we have scheduled a meeting, please be prepared by bringing some
reference to your old work and also to talk about it at length as well.
Unpreparedness is a sign of a lack of interest.</p></div><div class="area-bottom"><p class="subtle">Oh yeah, and thanks for taking the time to read this! XD</p><script type="text/javascript" src="site.js"></script></div></div></body></html>
