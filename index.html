I have several projects as well as some of my friends&#39;
to which I would like to see put into reality.</p><p class="highlight">I will pay you <span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span>
each week for 2 day(s) worth of concentrated coding.
You chose where, when, how <strong>and how long</strong>
to work and I will pay you in cash every saturdays
when we meet for the update.
</p><p>Read further if you are interested.</p><h2>One coder army</h2><p>Since <strong>one coder does not scale</strong> to multiple projects
and I have a full time job now (just like many of you guys)
I figured it is better that I hire other people to help
than to try to do everything myself and never gets anything done.</p><p class="highlight">Think of this as me doing micro-funding for my idea.
</p><p>I am a coder myself, so you can expect a lot of freedom to
go about how you do the job. Plus I understand how it is
so much better to work alone on your own terms than on a
team of sub-averages who don&#39;t understand the simplest
of your approach.</p><h2>Conditions</h2><ul><li>If you do not know me personally, I will have to ask you to
do some simple tests first (such as a FUBAR loop.)
</li><li>Bad coding style will be rejected on first sight.
</li><li>The constant here is the weekly pay of
<span class="money">&#3647;2,500</span>. If you are
good, feel free to spend only 2 hour(s) per week if you
think you can match that amount. Just remember that
I'm a coder too.
</li><li>I will inform you if I think you have been slacking or
you are doing more than meets the pay (e.g. when it's a holiday)
</li><li>You can skip any week whenever you want (pay for that week
will be skipped.) Just don't disappear for too long without
at least an email.
</li><li>There is nothing to sign. We prefer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy" alt="Meritocracy">Meritocracy</a>
over legalities.
</li><li>Also mean that anyone may stop working from either side at
any time, should the work (or pay) be unsatisfactory.
</li><li>Oh, and you have to be able to meet me in person in
Bankgok, Thailand. (hint: look at the domain.)
</li></ul><h2>Can I use Ruby/Python/Node.JS/X?</h2><p>Sure, use whatever you are good at. Personally, though, I hate
<code>PHP</code> and <code>Java</code> so try not to use it. An
all-<abbr title="opensource software">OSS</abbr> stack is also
preferred (but not required.)
</p><p>Cloud-hostable solution is also preferred (i.e. 
<a href="http://heroku.com" alt="Heroku">Heroku</a>.)
</p><p>We will share the responsibility of any deployment and keeping the
software up and running if the project is a website. Which means we
should both have administrative access to the servers.</p><h2>How do I get paid?</h2><p>In cash, in face-to-face meeting, every Saturdays in exchange
for the week&#39;s patch and half-an-hour of talk.</p><h3>How about sharing?</h3><p>Sure, if you think the project is a good idea to invest, I&#39;m
willing to share a large portion (up to 50%) of it with you.
We can negotiate this as soon as we have something viable for launch.</p><h2><a name="interested">Interested?</a></h2><p>Email me at <code>holidayhack</code> at my name dot net or ping me
<a href="http://twitter.com/chakrit">@chakrit</a> on Twitter to
get in touch. I will try to respond within 2 day(s) or no less
than a week if my workload is heavy.</p><p>Also, I may or may not give you a coding test to submit.
If you pass you will be briefed with the project&#39;s details
and date to start working right away.</p></div><div class="area-bottom"><p class="subtle">Oh yeah, and thanks for reading to the end :-)</p><script type="text/javascript" src="site.js"></script></div></div></body></html>
